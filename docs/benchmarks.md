# PolicyMind AI — Benchmark Scores

> This file is updated after every version that changes retrieval or generation.
> Scores are produced by running `pytest tests/rag_eval/` against the insurance benchmark dataset.
> Never update scores manually — run the evaluation and copy the output.

## Benchmark Dataset

**File:** `tests/rag_eval/insurance_benchmark.json`  
**Questions:** 15+ real insurance policy Q&A pairs  
**Document types:** Health insurance, property insurance, motor insurance  
**Covers:** Waiting periods, exclusions, sub-limits, conditions, claim procedures

## Score History

### V0 — Pre-Stabilization (estimated, not measured)

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Faithfulness | ~0.60 | Noisy context, no reranking |
| Answer Relevancy | ~0.65 | Fixed chunking loses clause context |
| Contextual Precision | ~0.55 | Single-stage cosine only |

## How to Run Evaluations

```bash
# Full RAG eval (needs real API keys)
cd backend
pytest tests/rag_eval/ -v --tb=short

# Single metric
pytest tests/rag_eval/ -v -k "faithfulness"

# With score output saved
pytest tests/rag_eval/ -v --tb=short 2>&1 | tee docs/eval_results/v$(VERSION).txt

# Load test
locust -f tests/locustfile.py --headless -u 50 -r 5 --run-time 5m --host http://localhost:8000
```

## Notes on Interpretation

- **Faithfulness** measures whether the answer is grounded in retrieved context (no hallucination). Most important metric.
- **Answer Relevancy** measures whether the answer addresses the question asked.
- **Contextual Precision** measures whether the retrieved chunks are actually relevant (noise in context = lower precision).
- **Contextual Recall** measures whether all relevant information was retrieved (missing clauses = lower recall).

A system can have high Faithfulness but low Recall (answers what it retrieved, but retrieved the wrong thing). Both must be high.
